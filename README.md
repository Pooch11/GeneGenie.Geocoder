# MultiGeocoder
A .Net standard geocoder library that can query multiple backend geocoders and rotate between them.

Currently supports Google and Bing geocoder APIs.

## Running multiple instances
If using this library in a multi-process environment (such as serverless functions or a webfarm) then you'll need to implement your own Geocoder selector with the interface IGeocoderSelector. The class you implement would need to figure out what geocoder to select next based on what was used previously by accessing a shared resource (Redis, database layer etc), This would typically involve a locking fetch / update on the resource. See InMemoryGeocoderSelector.cs for ideas.
